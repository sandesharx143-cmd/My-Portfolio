# 🤡 Joker's Nightmarish Anti-Gravity Portfolio

Welcome to the madness. This is a high-performance, cinematic portfolio designed to provide a terrifyingly immersive experience from the second it loads. Forget standard biographical sites—this is a digital breach into the mind of a world-class developer.

## 🎭 The Cinematic Experience

The site kicks off with an **Anti-Gravity Cinematic Sequence** that sets the tone:
1.  **Joker Morph**: Starts with a gritty Joker illustration that glitch-morphs into a secondary nightmare artwork with smoke and ink-splatter effects.
2.  **Anti-Gravity Drift**: A single Joker card drifts in slow-motion, moving upward and sideways as if caught in invisible atmospheric currents.
3.  **Surreal Reveal**: A stylized Tommy Gun with glowing neon highlights floats into the frame, symbolizing a breach in digital security.
4.  **The Void Shift**: The screen transitions to a stark white void filled with suspended playing cards.
5.  **Particle Synthesis**: The cards dissolve into thousands of particles, converging to form the name **NAGESH R** in a bold, horror-inspired reveal.

## 🩸 Core Features

-   **Blood Flood Background**: Post-intro, the site is submerged in a procedural "Blood Flood" animation—hundreds of red drips cascading down the screen, revealing hidden data as they flow.
-   **Hacker Terminal Aesthetic**: All data (Repos, Stars, Followers) is rebranded with hacker monospaced labels like `_DEAD_SYSTEM`, `Madness_Buffer`, and `Exploit_Points`.
-   **Subject ID Reports**: The 'About' page is structured as a psychiatric evaluation from Arkham Asylum, complete with a "Criminal Record" of tech specs.
-   **Madness Pathways**: A skills dashboard that categorizes expertise into "Neural Overwrites" and "Synthesized Viruses."
-   **Crosshair Cursor**: A custom digital target cursor that tracks movement across the dark, gritty carbon-fibre textures.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

-   **Backend**: Python (Flask) for routing and GitHub API integration.
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Vanilla), JavaScript (ES6+).
-   **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas for the blood physics, gravity drift, and particle engine.
-   **APIs**: GitHub REST API for real-time repository and user data stats.
